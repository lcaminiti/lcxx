SEPARATE
========

*   Test virtual calls via base classes (polimorphism), also pure virtuals
*   Test function overloads
*   Test const
*   Test volatile (this should just given a compiler error, maybe a static_assert)

From Eiffel site
----------------
*   (s->&*x::f)() should be allowed only if s is of type separate<x>::arg, and not directly on separate<x>
